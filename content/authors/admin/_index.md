Welcome to my website! I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Economics at Southern Methodist University. I am also a CESifo Research Network Affiliate. 

My research combines income and spending micro-data with quantitative life-cycle and spatial models to answer questions on macroeconomic policy and labor economics; with a particular focus on measuring the propagation and pass-through of income and price changes to individuals' welfare.
