abstract: This paper studies the role of earnings risk in reconciling the observed lower earnings returns in
self-employment. Using Spanish administrative data, we characterize the distribution and dynamics
of earnings and document lower and less dispersed earnings in self-employment. We consider
alternative hypotheses and highlight the role of lower unemployment risk in self-employment.
We decompose earnings risk dynamics by estimating a life-cycle earnings process. Indeed, the
self-employed experience lower returns but face lower volatility and persistence of shocks. Our
results rule out theories in favor of experimentation and earnings growth in self-employment, and
highlight the trade-off between earnings and unemployment risk.
